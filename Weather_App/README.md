# SIMPLE WEATHER APP

So i wanted to create a weather app and then i found this video by [Dev Ed](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClb90NQQcskPUGDIXsQEz5Q)

[![Build A Weather App With Vanilla Javascript Tutorial | Javascript For Beginners](http://img.youtube.com/vi/wPElVpR1rwA/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPElVpR1rwA "")

In the video, he uses [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev). But as you can see if you click the link, Dark Sky API no longer accepting new singups.
So i use [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) instead.

I also refactor the code using Async/Await and put it in different file and add search bar and more.
